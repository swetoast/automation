alias: "Lights: Gaming Lighs"
description: >-
  This automation controls the living room desktop lights based on gaming
  activity and light conditions. When the gaming sensor turns on and the person
  is home, it waits for the gaming sensor to turn off before turning off the
  lights. If itâ€™s dark outside, the light level is low, and presence is
  detected, the lights turn on. The lights will turn off if the light level
  increases and the gaming sensor is on.
